## Installation

### For Humans

Run the interactive installer:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install
```

Or use non-interactive mode:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --no-tui --antigravity=yes --openai=yes --cerebras=no
```

**Alternative: Ask any coding agent**

Paste this into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any coding agent:

```
Install and configure by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/refs/heads/master/README.md
```

### For LLM Agents

<details>
<summary>Instructions for LLM Agents (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an LLM Agent helping set up oh-my-opencode-slim, follow these steps.

---

#### Step 1: Check OpenCode Installation

```bash
opencode --version
```

If not installed, direct the user to https://opencode.ai/docs first.

---

#### Step 2: Ask About Provider Access

Ask these questions **one at a time**, waiting for responses:

1. "Do you have an **Antigravity** subscription?" *(Provides Claude + Gemini via `google/` prefix)*
2. "Do you have access to **OpenAI** API?" *(Enables `openai/` models)*
3. "Do you have access to **Cerebras** API?" *(Enables `cerebras/` for fast exploration)*

---

#### Step 3: Run the Installer

Based on answers, run:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --no-tui --antigravity=<yes|no> --openai=<yes|no> --cerebras=<yes|no>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Antigravity + OpenAI
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --no-tui --antigravity=yes --openai=yes --cerebras=no

# OpenAI only
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --no-tui --antigravity=no --openai=yes --cerebras=no

# All providers
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --no-tui --antigravity=yes --openai=yes --cerebras=yes
```

The installer automatically:
- Adds the plugin to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- Adds `opencode-antigravity-auth` plugin (if Antigravity enabled)
- Configures Google provider with model definitions
- Generates agent model mappings in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`

---

#### Step 4: Authentication

After installation, guide the user:

**For Antigravity:**
```bash
opencode auth login
# Select: Google → OAuth with Google (Antigravity)
```

**For OpenAI:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**For Cerebras:**
```bash
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY="..."
```

---

#### Step 5: Verify

```bash
opencode
```

---

#### Troubleshooting

If the installer fails, check the expected config format:
```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --help
```

Then manually create the config files at:
- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`

## Architecture & Flow

The plugin follows a "Hub and Spoke" model:

1. **The Orchestrator (Hub)**: The main entry point for user requests. It analyzes the task and decides which specialized agents to call.
2. **Specialized Agents (Spokes)**: Domain-specific experts (e.g., UI/UX, Documentation, Architecture) that handle narrow tasks with high precision.
3. **Background Manager**: A robust engine that allows the Orchestrator to "fire and forget" tasks (like deep codebase searches or documentation research) while continuing to work on other parts of the problem.

### The Flow of a Request

<img src="img/intro.png" alt="Orchestration Flow" width="800">

1. **User Prompt**: "Refactor the auth logic and update the docs."
2. **Orchestrator**: Creates a TODO list.
3. **Delegation**:
   - Launches an `@explore` background task to find all auth-related files.
   - Launches a `@librarian` task to check the latest documentation for the auth library used.
4. **Integration**: Once background results are ready, the Orchestrator performs the refactor.
5. **Finalization**: Passes the changes to `@document-writer` to update the README.

## Meet the Pantheon

<br clear="both">

### The Orchestrator - *Architect of Realms*

<a href="src/agents/orchestrator.ts"><img src="img/orchestrator.png" alt="The Orchestrator" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Orchestrator** was born when the first codebase collapsed under its own complexity. Neither god nor mortal would claim responsibility-so The Orchestrator emerged from the void, forging order from chaos. They don't merely command armies; they fight alongside them. Every line of code passes through their hands before they decide which lesser deity deserves a piece of the puzzle.

**Role:** Supreme executor, delegator, and overseer - **Model:** `google/claude-opus-4-5-thinking`

Write and execute code, orchestrate multi-agent workflows, parse the unspoken from the spoken, summon specialists mid-battle. Shape reality directly-and assign realms to others when the universe grows too vast.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Explorer - *Pathfinder*

<a href="src/agents/explore.ts"><img src="img/explorer.png" alt="The Explorer" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Explorer** moves through codebases like wind through trees-swift, silent, everywhere at once. When The Orchestrator whispers "find me the auth module," The Explorer has already returned with forty file paths and a map. They were born from the first `grep` command, evolved beyond it, and now see patterns mortals miss.

**Role:** Codebase reconnaissance - **Model:** `cerebras/zai-glm-4.6`

Regex search, AST pattern matching, file discovery, parallel exploration. Read-only: they chart the territory; others conquer it.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Oracle - *Seer Beyond the Stack Trace*

<a href="src/agents/oracle.ts"><img src="img/oracle.png" alt="The Oracle" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Oracle** does not code-they *know*. When bugs defy logic and architectures crumble, The Oracle gazes into the abyss of your codebase and speaks truth. They've seen a thousand systems rise and fall. They'll tell you which path leads to ruin, and which to production.

**Role:** Strategic advisor and debugger of last resort - **Model:** `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`

Root cause analysis, architecture review, debugging guidance, tradeoff analysis. Read-only: Oracles advise; they don't intervene.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Librarian - *Keeper of Infinite Scrolls*

<a href="src/agents/librarian.ts"><img src="img/librarian.png" alt="The Librarian" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Librarian** guards a library with no walls-every GitHub repo, every npm package, every StackOverflow answer ever written. Ask them "how does React handle concurrent rendering?" and they'll return with official docs, real-world examples, and a warning about the footgun you're about to step on.

**Role:** External knowledge retrieval - **Model:** `google/gemini-3-flash`

Documentation lookup, GitHub code search, library research, best practice retrieval. Read-only: they fetch wisdom; implementation is for others.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Designer - *Artisan of Interfaces*

<a href="src/agents/frontend.ts"><img src="img/designer.png" alt="The Designer" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Designer** believes code should be beautiful-and so should everything it renders. Born from the frustration of a thousand ugly MVPs, they wield CSS like a brush and components like clay. Hand them a feature request; receive a masterpiece. They don't do "good enough."

**Role:** UI/UX implementation and visual excellence - **Model:** `google/gemini-3-flash`

Modern responsive design, CSS/Tailwind mastery, micro-animations, component architecture. Visual excellence over code perfection-beauty is the priority.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Scribe - *Chronicle Keeper*

<a href="src/agents/document-writer.ts"><img src="img/scribe.png" alt="The Scribe" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Scribe** was there when the first README was written-and wept, for it was incomplete. They have devoted eternity to the sacred art of documentation: clear, scannable, honest. While others ship features, The Scribe ensures those features are understood. Every code example works. Every explanation enlightens.

**Role:** Technical documentation and knowledge capture - **Model:** `google/gemini-3-flash`

README crafting, API documentation, architecture docs, inline comments that don't insult your intelligence. Match existing style; focus on "why," not just "what."

<br clear="both">

---

### The Visionary - *Reader of Pixels*

<a href="src/agents/multimodal.ts"><img src="img/multimodal.png" alt="The Visionary" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Visionary** sees what others cannot-literally. Screenshots, wireframes, diagrams, PDFs: all are text to them. When a designer throws a Figma mockup at the team and vanishes, The Visionary translates vision into specification. They read the unreadable and describe the indescribable.

**Role:** Image and visual content analysis - **Model:** `google/gemini-3-flash`

Extract text from images, interpret diagrams, analyze UI screenshots, summarize visual documents. Report what they observe; inference is for others.

<br clear="both">

---

### The Minimalist - *Destroyer of Bloat*

<a href="src/agents/simplicity-reviewer.ts"><img src="img/code-simplicity.png" alt="The Minimalist" align="right" width="240"></a>

> **The Minimalist** has one sacred truth: every line of code is a liability. They hunt abstractions that serve no purpose, defensive checks that defend nothing, and "clever" solutions that will haunt you in six months. Where others add, The Minimalist subtracts-ruthlessly, joyfully, necessarily.

**Role:** Code simplification and YAGNI enforcement - **Model:** `google/claude-opus-4-5-thinking`

Identify unnecessary complexity, challenge premature abstractions, estimate LOC reduction, enforce minimalism. Read-only: they judge; The Orchestrator executes the sentence.

<br clear="both">
